        <h2>About Us</h2>

          <p>Be Smart, Eat Smart was a product borne out of personal experience. Having two parents who suffer from diabetes and means that it is an incredibly difficult task to find snacks that are safe enough for them to eat. Therefore, I've tried my best to include items that can be tasty as well as safe for them to consume. It was observed that India has an estimated 77 million people (1 in 11 Indians) formally diagnosed with diabetes, which makes it the second most affected in the world, after China. Furthermore, 700,000 Indians died of diabetes, hyperglycemia, kidney disease or other complications of diabetes in 2020. One in six people (17%) in the world with diabetes is from India. (Indiaâ€™s population as calculated in October 2018 was about 17.5% of the global total.) The number is projected to grow by 2045 to become 134 million per the International Diabetes Federation.I hope this website will prove to be useful for endeavours such as these.<br><br>We hope perusing this website will lead to a fruitful outcome.</p>
