        <h2>Cardiovascular diseases</h2>

          <p>The following should be kept in mind to ensure a wholesome diet for people with heart diseases:</p>
            <br>
            <br>1. How much you eat is just as important as what you eat. Overloading your plate, taking seconds and eating until you feel stuffed can lead to eating more calories than you should. Portions served in restaurants are often more than anyone needs.<br>
            <br>2. Vegetables and fruits are good sources of vitamins and minerals. They are also low in calories and rich in dietary fiber. Unlike other plants or plant-based foods, contain substances that may help prevent cardiovascular disease. Eating more fruits and vegetables may help you cut back on higher calorie foods, such as meat, cheese and snack foods.<br>
     
            <br>3. Limiting how much saturated and trans fats you eat is an important step to reduce your blood cholesterol and lower your risk of coronary artery disease. A high blood cholesterol level can lead to a buildup of plaques in the arteries, called atherosclerosis, which can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.

          <h2>Diabetes</h2>

          <p>The following should be kept in mind to ensure a holistic diet for people with diabetes:</p>
            <br>
            <br>1. Eat foods with heart-healthy fats, which mainly come from these foods:<br>
            
              <br>a. oils that are liquid at room temperature, such as canola and olive oil<br>
              <br>b. nuts and seeds<br>
              <br>c. heart-healthy fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel<br>
              <br>d. avocado<br>
            
            
            <br>
            <br>2. If you drink alcohol, drink moderately—no more than one drink a day if you’re a woman or two drinks a day if you’re a man. If you use insulin or diabetes medicines that increase the amount of insulin your body makes, alcohol can make your blood glucose level drop too low. <br>
     
            <br>3. Eating the right amount of food will also help you manage your blood glucose level and your weight. Your health care team can help you figure out how much food and how many calories you should eat each day.<br>
